      <h2>Introduction</h2>
      <p>
        The Victorian Default Offer (VDO) is a default electricity deal determined each year by the Essential Services Commission (ESC), Victoria’s independent energy regulator. The ESC claim that the VDO provides Victorian consumers access to a fair electricity deal. In this discussion, we examine whether this is indeed the case, and also look at whether the VDO is having an impact on the way Victorian electricity retailers are pricing market offers.
      </p>
      <p>
        A residential electricity customer in Victoria is able to access market offers and standing offers. Standing offers are contracts that are provided when a customer has not engaged directly with the market – for example, by never signing up for an electricity contract, or by moving address and not entering into a new contract. Market offers are competitive offers set by the electricity retailers. There is no restriction to how often a retailer is able to set new market offers.
        The VDO was introduced on 1 July 2019 as part of the Victorian state government’s Energy Fairness Plan. It applies to all standing offers and is therefore the unique standing offer that will apply to a customer if they are unable or unwilling to engage in the market. In this discussion we will refer to such customers as reluctant customers. The stated intention of the VDO is to provide a simple and fair offer to reluctant customers. 
        Approximately a month before the end of every calendar year since the inception of the VDO, the ESC produces a publicly available report setting out the methodology used to calculate the VDO for the following year as well as the VDO prices themselves. This occurs after a consultation period in which the electricity retailers and other stakeholders are invited to make submissions influencing the report. 
        The VDO is calculated in a transparent manner (in the sense that it should be possible for an interested layperson to reproduce the calculation) and is made up of components accounting for wholesale costs, network costs, environmental costs, retail costs and other costs.
        To provide focus for our discussion we will look only at residential consumers within the CitiPower distribution region. In addition we examine only flat-tariff VDO and market offers. These are by far the most common offer type and will likely be most appealing to reluctant customers due to their simple structure. They include a daily supply charge (AUD per day) as well as a usage charge (AUD per kWh).

        <h3>Questions</h3>
        <p>
          In 2017, the Independent Review into the Electricity and Gas Retail Markets in Victoria investigated how the then deregulated Victorian electricity retail market was functioning. 
          The review found that the market was failing consumers and made 11 recommendations which were intended to improve outcomes for Victorian energy consumers. 
          The first and most far reaching of these was the introduction of a Basic Service Offer, which later became known as the Victorian Default Offer. 
          According to the Essential Services Commission website, the Victorian Default Offer:
        </p>
        <p class="issue">
          <i>...provides Victorian consumers access to a fair electricity deal even if they are unable or unwilling to engage in the retail market.</i>
        </p>
        <p>
          The review found three main factors for the perceived market failure which the VDO intended to address. These were:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            The cost of competition
          </li>
          <li>
            The structure of the market
          </li>
          <li>
            The practices of industry
          </li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          Therefore, the purpose of this working paper is to investigate the following questions:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            Is the VDO providing a fair deal to consumers?
          </li>
          <li>
            Has the structure of the market improved since the introduction of the VDO?
          </li>
          <li>
            Have the practices of industry improved since the introduction of the VDO?

        <h3>Data</h3>
        <p>
          We use three sources of data for our discussion, analysis of which has been undertaken using both the R and Python programming languages.
        </p>
        <p>
          The first are the historical VDO prices which are all taken from the ESC website. 
        </p>
        <p>
          The second are historical fixed, flat-tariff market offers, for each electricity retailer operating in Victoria. These have been extracted from the Victorian Energy Compare website using web scraping software. We will refer to this data set as the offers data set.
        </p>
        <p>
          The third are the market share classifications, in 2020, for each electricity retailer operating in Victoria. These were presented in the Victorian Energy Market Report published by the Essential Services Commission (ESC).

        <h3>A Fair Deal for Consumers?</h3>
        <p>
          The Victorian State Government webpage on the VDO states that: 
        </p>
        <p class="issue">
          <i>the VDO is a fair offer but not necessarily the cheapest price for you</i>
        </p>
        <p>
          The Essential Services Commissions’ terms of reference and subsequent statements from the Premier and Minister for Energy, Environment and Climate Change (including the VDO Bill’s second reading in Parliament) also make clear that the purpose of the VDO is to provide customers with universal access to a ‘fair’ priced electricity offer.
        </p>
        <p>
          There are two questions related to the fairness of the VDO:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            Whether the VDO itself is a fair offer from a consumer perspective
          </li>
          <li>
            Whether the VDO assists in creating a fairer market.
          </li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          The Thwaites review notes that:
        </p>
        <p class="issue">
          <i>As an essential service, consumers must purchase energy and must participate in the retail market even if they are not interested in the product and regardless of continued price rises</i>
        </p>
        <p>
          This is undoubtedly true, but should we therefore conclude that the disinterested consumer not receiving the best prices is unfair? 
          On the flip side, this means that the interested consumer is able to achieve lower prices – which could be considered the fairest situations depending on your point of view.
        </p>
        <p>
          Indeed, fairness in the sense of equality is achieved by requiring that all standing offers be replaced with the VDO so that every customer on such an offer is treated equally regardless of which retailer they are with. 
          The ESC has also achieved a sense of fairness by linking the calculation of the VDO to factors such as wholesale prices and reasonable retailer profit margins. 
          However, many reluctant customers on the VDO who accept that they may not be getting the cheapest price for their electricity might be surprised to find out how poorly the VDO fares in comparison to market offers – even when the market offers selected are not from the cheapest retailers.
        </p>
        <p>
          One illustration of this is found by examining the following figure. 
          We have calculated the history of the best flat rate market offers for each retailer and averaged over each retail group. 
          This is then compared this to the history of the VDO. It is evident that the VDO is rarely able to compete with even the most expensive market offers, and in many cases is much worse. 
        </p>
        
        '<iframe id="igraph" scrolling="no" style="border:none;" seamless="seamless" src="average_history.html" height="525" width="100%"></iframe>'
        
        <p>
          Indeed, if a customer had randomly selected a flat rate deal amongst a particular retailer group on 1 December 2020 the following bar chart illustrated how much they would have saved (relative to the VDO) over the subsequent year. 
          Interestingly this also illustrates that it is not necessary to investigate all retailers’ offers in order to improve significantly on the VDO – a customer who wishes only to deal with large retailers would also save over $150 over the year.

      <section id="structure">
        <h3>The Structure of the Market</h3>
        <p>
          The Thwaites review noted the differences between the large, medium and small retailers and noted that the large retailers were charging amongst the most expensive offers and took this as evidence that the more established retailers were not being put under competitive pressure by the medium and small retailers to lower their prices. 
          They state:
        </p>
        <p class="issue">
          <i>If the competitive market was working we would not expect to see the low-cost supplier at the top of the price range and the high-cost supplier at the lower end</i>
        </p>
        <p>
          This is one of the identified market failures the VDO was supposed to address.  
          To measure this over the existence of the VDO we have calculated the mean best flat rate offers from both the large and medium sized retailers since the introduction to investigate whether the medium retailers have been able to put the large retailers under greater competitive pressure. 
          Our results are shown in the figure below.
        </p>
        
         '<iframe id="igraph" scrolling="no" style="border:none;" seamless="seamless" src="large_vs_medium.html" height="525" width="100%"></iframe>'
        
        <p>
          We have calculated the average flat rate offer over each retail group at quarterly intervals since the introduction of the VDO. 
          On average the large retailers still price at $33 above the medium retailers for a consumer with an annual usage of 4MWh. 
          Only in one case (January 2021) did the large retailers compete with the medium-sized retailers on price.
          It is evident that there has been no significant change in the difference between the large and medium retailers' pricing over this period.
          Therefore, by the contrapositive of the above statement from the Thwaites Review, we can conclude that the competitive market is not working by this measure.
        </p>
        <p>
          Another commonly used measure of market concentration is the Herfindahl Index (HHI). 
          This is calculated by summing the squares of the market shares of all competitors in the market. 
          For example, a monopoly would have a HHI of 1, and a market consisting of 100 participants with an equal market share would have a very small HHI of 0.01. 
          The HHI thus decreases if:

          Let’s look at the example of authorship information. Some properties of the agent who
          authored the document (person or organization), such as their name, are considered to be
          true outside the limited context of the document. These properties will be set directly on
          the agent.

      <section id="practices">
        <h3>The Practices of the Market</h3>
        <p>
          It is worth taking a step back to understand the importance of the <em>role</em>
          modeling. Its application is clearly exemplified in the <a href="#authors">Authors &amp;
          Contributors</a> section wherein a <a>sa:ContributorRole</a> type is used as a wrapper
          and not <a>schema:Person</a> or <a>schema:Organization</a> directly.
        </p>
        <p>
          Roles are an indirection that provides additional information about a property or
          relationship. A simple overview is provided in the schema.org blog post
          <a href="http://blog.schema.org/2014/06/introducing-role.html">Introducing ’Role’</a>.
        </p>
        
         '<iframe id="igraph" scrolling="no" style="border:none;" seamless="seamless" src="random_customer.html" height="525" width="100%"></iframe>'
        
        <p>
          Let’s look at the example of authorship information. Some properties of the agent who
          authored the document (person or organization), such as their name, are considered to be
          true outside the limited context of the document. These properties will be set directly on
          the agent.
        </p>
        <p>
          On the other hand, other properties are considered to be specific to the agent
          <em>in their role as author of the document</em>. To give an example, were I to be
          writing the document you are currently reading as a freelancer for the Illuminati, my
          affiliation to them would be solely in my role as author and I should not be considered
          eternally indentured to them.
        </p>
        <p>
          When a role is used to enrich a property, the convention is to have it as the value of
          that property, and then to repeat the property on the role to point to the object. At
          first glance it sounds contrived, but it is a simple and powerful construct. To stay with
          the authoring example, the indirection would look like:
        </p>
        <p>
          To demonstrate how properties can attach differently to the role and to the agent, we can
          unfold the authorship example further:
