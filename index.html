      <p>
        Scholarly HTML is a domain-specific rich document format built entirely on open standards
        that enables the interoperable exchange of scholarly articles in a manner that is compatible
        with off-the-shelf browsers. This document describes how Scholarly HTML works and how it is
        encoded.

      <h2>Introduction</h2>
      <p>
        Scholarly articles are still primarily published as unstructured data in which most of the
        information created by the research and the practice of authoring is lost. Document
        technology has reached a level of maturity and universality that makes this situation no
        longer tenable. Information cannot be disseminated if it is destroyed before even having
        left its creator’s laptop.
      </p>

      <p>
        According to the New York Times, adding structured information to their recipes improved
        their discoverability to the point of producing an immediate rise of 52 percent in traffic
        (<a role="doc-biblioref">NYT</a>). At this point in time, cupcake recipes are reaping
        greater benefits from modern data format practices than the whole scientific endeavour.
      </p>
      
      '<iframe id="igraph" scrolling="no" style="border:none;" seamless="seamless" src="large_retailers.html" height="525" width="100%"></iframe>'
      <p>
        This places a great burden on tool developers and service providers as well. Anyone who
        has explored the world of extracting data from inert publications has built their own
        complex toolset, offering no interoprability, no opportunity for cooperative improvements,
        and little or no growth in discoverability or meta-analysis in this area.
      </p>
      <p>
        To address these issues, we have followed an approach rooted in established best practices
        for the reuse of open, standard formats. We propose an "HTML Vernacular", a set of
        guidelines for the creation of domain-specific data formats that make use of HTML’s
        inherent extensibility  (<a role="doc-biblioref">Science.AI, 2015</a>). Using the
        vernacular foundation overlaid with schema.org metadata and proposed extensions to it, we
        have produced a format for the authoring and interchange of scholarly articles built on
        open standards, ready for all to use. We hope that this format will be usable
        <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2016/03/16/science/asap-bio-biologists-published-to-the-internet.html?_r=1">rogue
        scientists</a> who choose to publish their articles on their own.
      </p>
      <p>
        Our high-level goals are to:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>Enable structured metadata, accessibility, and internationalisation.</li>
        <li>Be fully funcitioning on modern Web browsers.</li>
        <li>
          Be customizable for inclusion in arbitrary Web sites, while remaining easy to process
          and interoperable.
        </li>
        <li>Build on top of open, royalty-free standards.</li>
        <li>Long-term viability as a data format.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        Where semantic modeling is concerned, our approach is to stick as much as possible to the
        schema.org. Beyond the obvious advantages there are in reusing a vocabulary that is
        supported by all the major search engines and is actively being developed towards enabling a
        shared understanding of many useful concepts, it also provides a protection against
        <i>ontological drift</i> whereby a new vocabulary is defined by a small group with
        insufficient input from a broader community of practice. A language that solely a single
        participant understands is of limited value.
      </p>
      <p>
        In a limited number of cases we have had to depart from schema.org, using the
        <code>https://ns.science.ai/</code>, prefixed with <code>sa:</code>. Our goal is to work
        with schema.org in order to extend their vocabulary, and we will align our usage with the
        outcome of these discussions.
      </p>
      <p>
        A Scholarly HTML document is a valid <a role="doc-biblioref">HTML</a> document that follows
        some additional rules to specialize its meaning and make it predictable to processors
        wishing to produce or consume scholarly articles. These rules are outlined in the following
        sections. While valuable on its own, the content structure defined here is simply a stepping
        stone to enable semantic enrichment, detailed in <a href="#semantics">Semantics
        Overlays</a>. If you would like to write a validation tool, please join us on GitHub.

      <h2>Discussion</h2>
      <p>
        HTML provides an excellent backbone with which to capture the
        <a href="#structure">structure</a> of a given text but is evidently limited when it comes to
        capturing more domain-specific concepts such as people, spaceships,
        <a href="http://existentialcomics.com/comic/122">Humean causation</a>, or
        <a href="http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0109888">sthenurines</a>.
        That is where semantic overlays with the ability to refine the meaning and relations of
        HTML elements come into play. Scholarly HTML makes use of two standard mechanisms that
        overlay additional semantics atop the HTML DOM: role-based semantics as defined by
        <a role="doc-biblioref">WAI-ARIA</a> and <a role="doc-biblioref">DPUB-ARIA</a>, and
        semantics rooted in structured data as captured by <a role="doc-biblioref">RDFa</a>.
      </p>
      <p>
        Using technologies related to the semantic web can at times feel daunting and unrelated to
        everyday web development. In order to suppress this disconnect, Scholarly HTML follows a
        few simple guiding principles:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          The number of prefixes used for semantic properties is kept as small as possible;
        </li>
        <li>
          There is no such thing as a URI (or URN, IRI, XRI, or whatever else confusing
          contraption), everything is a URL;
        </li>
        <li>
          Where somewhat more complex modeling is required, it is put together using a small set of
          common patterns that might require some initial learning but can be applied regularly
          with relative ease (notably <a href="#roles">roles</a> and actions).
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        The properties that Scholarly HTML uses are naturally document-related (authorship,
        keywords, license, citations, as well as specific structure types such as acknowledgements,
        introduction, or funding), which additionally requires the ability to describe people and
        organizations. There are numerous vocabularies that address this domain and which could be
        used with <a role="doc-biblioref">RDFa</a>; however, for reasons detailed in
        <a href="https://research.science.ai/article/web-first-data-citations#choice-of-ontology">Web-First
        Data Citations</a> Scholarly HTML relies almost exclusively on
        <a role="doc-biblioref">schema.org</a>, complemented by a small number of additions from
        the <a href="#scholarly-article">Scholarly Article Vocabulary</a>.

          Marking up persons and organizations can make use of any applicable properties in
          <a>schema:Person</a> and <a>schema:Organization</a>, respectively, but it is worth
          pointing out some good practices with how these are to be used in practice.
        </p>
        <p>
          If the entity in question has a URL then it is best to use that as its identifier (using
          the <code>resource</code> attribute) and additionally to provide it as a link using the
          <code>a</code> element (see the <a href="#person-example">person example</a> for an
          instance of this).
        </p>
        <p>
          If you happen to have information providing both the
          <a>schema:givenName</a>/<a>schema:familyName</a><a>schema:additionalName</a> triple and
          the <a>schema:name</a> (which can be considered to contain the name as the person wishes
          it to be displayed) for a person then it is (perhaps counterintuitively) best to
          include <em>all</em> of them and then use CSS (typically sibling selectors) to hide the
          extraneous ones (alternatively, they can be captured using the <code>meta</code> element).
          The reason for this is that it exposes more information to machine consumers without
          having a negative impact on human readers.

          It is worth taking a step back to understand the importance of the <em>role</em>
          modeling. Its application is clearly exemplified in the <a href="#authors">Authors &amp;
          Contributors</a> section wherein a <a>sa:ContributorRole</a> type is used as a wrapper
          and not <a>schema:Person</a> or <a>schema:Organization</a> directly.
        </p>
        <p>
          Roles are an indirection that provides additional information about a property or
          relationship. A simple overview is provided in the schema.org blog post

        </p>
        <p>
          Let’s look at the example of authorship information. Some properties of the agent who
          authored the document (person or organization), such as their name, are considered to be
          true outside the limited context of the document. These properties will be set directly on
          the agent.
        </p>
        <p>
          On the other hand, other properties are considered to be specific to the agent
          <em>in their role as author of the document</em>. To give an example, were I to be
          writing the document you are currently reading as a freelancer for the Illuminati, my
          affiliation to them would be solely in my role as author and I should not be considered
          eternally indentured to them.
        </p>
        <p>
          When a role is used to enrich a property, the convention is to have it as the value of
          that property, and then to repeat the property on the role to point to the object. At
          first glance it sounds contrived, but it is a simple and powerful construct. To stay with
          the authoring example, the indirection would look like:
        </p>
        <p>
          <a>schema:ScholarlyArticle</a> ⟼
          <em><a>schema:author</a></em> ⟼
          <a>sa:ContributorRole</a> ⟼
          <em><a>schema:author</a></em> ⟼
          <a>schema:Person</a>
        </p>
        <p>
          To demonstrate how properties can attach differently to the role and to the agent, we can
          unfold the authorship example further:

      <h2>Conclusions and Further Research</h2>
      <p>
        A limited number of classes and properties are currently not available from
        <a role="doc-biblioref">schema.org</a>. In most if not all cases it would be desirable to
        make them available there, but while work is progressing it is simpler to define them
        ourselves.
      </p>
      <p class="issue">
        The current URL for the Scholarly Article vocabulary is
        <code>http://ns.science.ai/</code>. It may be desirable (should the vocabulary persist) to
        use a different URL. But this issue might go away if schema.org steps up.
