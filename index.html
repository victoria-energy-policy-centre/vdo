      <h2>Introduction</h2>
      <p>
        The Victorian Default Offer (VDO) is a default electricity deal determined each year by the Essential Services Commission (ESC), Victoria’s independent energy regulator. The ESC claim that the VDO provides Victorian consumers access to a fair electricity deal. In this discussion, we examine whether this is indeed the case, and also look at whether the VDO is having an impact on the way Victorian electricity retailers are pricing market offers.
      </p>
      <p>
        A residential electricity customer in Victoria is able to access market offers and standing offers. Standing offers are contracts that are provided when a customer has not engaged directly with the market – for example, by never signing up for an electricity contract, or by moving address and not entering into a new contract. Market offers are competitive offers set by the electricity retailers. There is no restriction to how often a retailer is able to set new market offers.
The VDO was introduced on 1 July 2019 as part of the Victorian state government’s Energy Fairness Plan. It applies to all standing offers and is therefore the unique standing offer that will apply to a customer if they are unable or unwilling to engage in the market. In this discussion we will refer to such customers as reluctant customers. The stated intention of the VDO is to provide a simple and fair offer to reluctant customers. 
Approximately a month before the end of every calendar year since the inception of the VDO, the ESC produces a publicly available report setting out the methodology used to calculate the VDO for the following year as well as the VDO prices themselves. This occurs after a consultation period in which the electricity retailers and other stakeholders are invited to make submissions influencing the report. 
The VDO is calculated in a transparent manner (in the sense that it should be possible for an interested layperson to reproduce the calculation) and is made up of components accounting for wholesale costs, network costs, environmental costs, retail costs and other costs.
To provide focus for our discussion we will look only at residential consumers within the CitiPower distribution region. In addition we examine only flat-tariff VDO and market offers. These are by far the most common offer type and will likely be most appealing to reluctant customers due to their simple structure. They include a daily supply charge (AUD per day) as well as a usage charge (AUD per kWh).

        <p>
          The first are the historical VDO prices which are all taken from the ESC website. 
        </p>
        <p>
          The second are historical fixed, flat-tariff market offers, for each electricity retailer operating in Victoria. These have been extracted from the Victorian Energy Compare website using web scraping software. We will refer to this data set as the offers data set.
        </p>
        <p>
          The third are the market share classifications, in 2020, for each electricity retailer operating in Victoria. These were presented in the Victorian Energy Market Report published by the Essential Services Commission (ESC).

      <h2>Discussion</h2>
      <p>
        HTML provides an excellent backbone with which to capture the
        <a href="#structure">structure</a> of a given text but is evidently limited when it comes to
        capturing more domain-specific concepts such as people, spaceships,
        <a href="http://existentialcomics.com/comic/122">Humean causation</a>, or
        <a href="http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0109888">sthenurines</a>.
        That is where semantic overlays with the ability to refine the meaning and relations of
        HTML elements come into play. Scholarly HTML makes use of two standard mechanisms that
        overlay additional semantics atop the HTML DOM: role-based semantics as defined by
        <a role="doc-biblioref">WAI-ARIA</a> and <a role="doc-biblioref">DPUB-ARIA</a>, and
        semantics rooted in structured data as captured by <a role="doc-biblioref">RDFa</a>.
      </p>
      <p>
        Using technologies related to the semantic web can at times feel daunting and unrelated to
        everyday web development. In order to suppress this disconnect, Scholarly HTML follows a
        few simple guiding principles:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          The number of prefixes used for semantic properties is kept as small as possible;
        </li>
        <li>
          There is no such thing as a URI (or URN, IRI, XRI, or whatever else confusing
          contraption), everything is a URL;
        </li>
        <li>
          Where somewhat more complex modeling is required, it is put together using a small set of
          common patterns that might require some initial learning but can be applied regularly
          with relative ease (notably <a href="#roles">roles</a> and actions).
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        The properties that Scholarly HTML uses are naturally document-related (authorship,
        keywords, license, citations, as well as specific structure types such as acknowledgements,
        introduction, or funding), which additionally requires the ability to describe people and
        organizations. There are numerous vocabularies that address this domain and which could be
        used with <a role="doc-biblioref">RDFa</a>; however, for reasons detailed in
        <a href="https://research.science.ai/article/web-first-data-citations#choice-of-ontology">Web-First
        Data Citations</a> Scholarly HTML relies almost exclusively on
        <a role="doc-biblioref">schema.org</a>, complemented by a small number of additions from
        the <a href="#scholarly-article">Scholarly Article Vocabulary</a>.

          Marking up persons and organizations can make use of any applicable properties in
          <a>schema:Person</a> and <a>schema:Organization</a>, respectively, but it is worth
          pointing out some good practices with how these are to be used in practice.
        </p>
        '<iframe id="igraph" scrolling="no" style="border:none;" seamless="seamless" src="average_history.html" height="525" width="100%"></iframe>'
        <p>
          If the entity in question has a URL then it is best to use that as its identifier (using
          the <code>resource</code> attribute) and additionally to provide it as a link using the
          <code>a</code> element (see the <a href="#person-example">person example</a> for an
          instance of this).
        </p>
        <p>
          If you happen to have information providing both the
          <a>schema:givenName</a>/<a>schema:familyName</a><a>schema:additionalName</a> triple and
          the <a>schema:name</a> (which can be considered to contain the name as the person wishes
          it to be displayed) for a person then it is (perhaps counterintuitively) best to
          include <em>all</em> of them and then use CSS (typically sibling selectors) to hide the
          extraneous ones (alternatively, they can be captured using the <code>meta</code> element).
          The reason for this is that it exposes more information to machine consumers without
          having a negative impact on human readers.

          On the other hand, other properties are considered to be specific to the agent
          <em>in their role as author of the document</em>. To give an example, were I to be

          affiliation to them would be solely in my role as author and I should not be considered
          eternally indentured to them.

        <p>
          When a role is used to enrich a property, the convention is to have it as the value of
          that property, and then to repeat the property on the role to point to the object. At
          first glance it sounds contrived, but it is a simple and powerful construct. To stay with
          the authoring example, the indirection would look like:
        </p>
        <p>
          <a>schema:ScholarlyArticle</a> ⟼
          <em><a>schema:author</a></em> ⟼
          <a>sa:ContributorRole</a> ⟼
          <em><a>schema:author</a></em> ⟼
          <a>schema:Person</a>
        </p>
        <p>
          To demonstrate how properties can attach differently to the role and to the agent, we can
          unfold the authorship example further:
        </p>
        <figure typeof="schema:SoftwareSourceCode" resource="#role-example" id="role-example">
          <pre>
<a>schema:ScholarlyArticle</a>

    │ └─<a>schema:Person</a>
    │   ├─<a>schema:name</a> = Bruce Banner
    │   └─<a>schema:url</a> = http://berjon.com/
    └─<a>sa:roleAffiliation</a>
      └─<a>schema:Organization</a>
        ├─<a>schema:name</a> = Illuminati
        └─<a>schema:address</a> = Bavaria
          </pre>

              Example of a role being used to model authorship. This effectively states that my

      <h2>Conclusions and Further Research</h2>
      <p>
        A limited number of classes and properties are currently not available from
        <a role="doc-biblioref">schema.org</a>. In most if not all cases it would be desirable to
        make them available there, but while work is progressing it is simpler to define them
        ourselves.
      </p>
      <p class="issue">
        The current URL for the Scholarly Article vocabulary is
        <code>http://ns.science.ai/</code>. It may be desirable (should the vocabulary persist) to
        use a different URL. But this issue might go away if schema.org steps up.
