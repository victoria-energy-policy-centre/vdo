      <h2>Introduction</h2>
      <p>
        The Victorian Default Offer (VDO) is a default electricity deal determined each year by the Essential Services Commission (ESC), Victoria’s independent energy regulator. The ESC claim that the VDO provides Victorian consumers access to a fair electricity deal. In this discussion, we examine whether this is indeed the case, and also look at whether the VDO is having an impact on the way Victorian electricity retailers are pricing market offers.
      </p>
      <p>
        A residential electricity customer in Victoria is able to access market offers and standing offers. Standing offers are contracts that are provided when a customer has not engaged directly with the market – for example, by never signing up for an electricity contract, or by moving address and not entering into a new contract. Market offers are competitive offers set by the electricity retailers. There is no restriction to how often a retailer is able to set new market offers.
        The VDO was introduced on 1 July 2019 as part of the Victorian state government’s Energy Fairness Plan. It applies to all standing offers and is therefore the unique standing offer that will apply to a customer if they are unable or unwilling to engage in the market. In this discussion we will refer to such customers as reluctant customers. The stated intention of the VDO is to provide a simple and fair offer to reluctant customers. 
        Approximately a month before the end of every calendar year since the inception of the VDO, the ESC produces a publicly available report setting out the methodology used to calculate the VDO for the following year as well as the VDO prices themselves. This occurs after a consultation period in which the electricity retailers and other stakeholders are invited to make submissions influencing the report. 
        The VDO is calculated in a transparent manner (in the sense that it should be possible for an interested layperson to reproduce the calculation) and is made up of components accounting for wholesale costs, network costs, environmental costs, retail costs and other costs.
        To provide focus for our discussion we will look only at residential consumers within the CitiPower distribution region. In addition we examine only flat-tariff VDO and market offers. These are by far the most common offer type and will likely be most appealing to reluctant customers due to their simple structure. They include a daily supply charge (AUD per day) as well as a usage charge (AUD per kWh).

        <h3>Questions</h3>
        <p>
          In 2017, the Independent Review into the Electricity and Gas Retail Markets in Victoria investigated how the then deregulated Victorian electricity retail market was functioning. 
          The review found that the market was failing consumers and made 11 recommendations which were intended to improve outcomes for Victorian energy consumers. 
          The first and most far reaching of these was the introduction of a Basic Service Offer, which later became known as the Victorian Default Offer. 
          According to the Essential Services Commission website, the Victorian Default Offer:
        </p>
        <p class="issue">
          <i>...provides Victorian consumers access to a fair electricity deal even if they are unable or unwilling to engage in the retail market.</i>
        </p>
        <p>
          The review found three main factors for the perceived market failure which the VDO intended to address. These were:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            The cost of competition
          </li>
          <li>
            The structure of the market
          </li>
          <li>
            The practices of industry
          </li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          Therefore, the purpose of this working paper is to investigate the following questions:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            Is the VDO providing a fair deal to consumers?
          </li>
          <li>
            Has the structure of the market improved since the introduction of the VDO?
          </li>
          <li>
            Have the practices of industry improved since the introduction of the VDO?
          </li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Data</h3>
        <p>
          We use three sources of data for our discussion, analysis of which has been undertaken using both the R and Python programming languages.
        </p>
        <p>
          The first are the historical VDO prices which are all taken from the ESC website. 
        </p>
        <p>
          The second are historical fixed, flat-tariff market offers, for each electricity retailer operating in Victoria. These have been extracted from the Victorian Energy Compare website using web scraping software. We will refer to this data set as the offers data set.
        </p>
        <p>
          The third are the market share classifications, in 2020, for each electricity retailer operating in Victoria. These were presented in the Victorian Energy Market Report published by the Essential Services Commission (ESC).

      <section id="fair">
        <h3>A Fair Deal for Consumers?</h3>
        <p>
          The Victorian State Government webpage on the VDO states that: 
        </p>
        <p class="issue">
          <i>the VDO is a fair offer but not necessarily the cheapest price for you</i>
        </p>
        <p>
          The Essential Services Commissions’ terms of reference and subsequent statements from the Premier and Minister for Energy, Environment and Climate Change (including the VDO Bill’s second reading in Parliament) also make clear that the purpose of the VDO is to provide customers with universal access to a ‘fair’ priced electricity offer.
        </p>
        <p>
          There are two questions related to the fairness of the VDO:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            Whether the VDO itself is a fair offer from a consumer perspective
          </li>
          <li>
            Whether the VDO assists in creating a fairer market.
          </li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          The Thwaites review notes that:
        </p>
        <p class="issue">
          <i>As an essential service, consumers must purchase energy and must participate in the retail market even if they are not interested in the product and regardless of continued price rises</i>
        </p>
        <p>
          This is undoubtedly true, but should we therefore conclude that the disinterested consumer not receiving the best prices is unfair? 
          On the flip side, this means that the interested consumer is able to achieve lower prices – which could be considered the fairest situations depending on your point of view.
        </p>
        <p>
          Indeed, fairness in the sense of equality is achieved by requiring that all standing offers be replaced with the VDO so that every customer on such an offer is treated equally regardless of which retailer they are with. 
          The ESC has also achieved a sense of fairness by linking the calculation of the VDO to factors such as wholesale prices and reasonable retailer profit margins. 
          However, many reluctant customers on the VDO who accept that they may not be getting the cheapest price for their electricity might be surprised to find out how poorly the VDO fares in comparison to market offers – even when the market offers selected are not from the cheapest retailers.
        </p>
        <p>
          One illustration of this is found by examining the following figure. 
          We have calculated the history of the best flat rate market offers for each retailer and averaged over each retail group. 
          This is then compared this to the history of the VDO. It is evident that the VDO is rarely able to compete with even the most expensive market offers, and in many cases is much worse. 
        </p>
        
        '<iframe id="igraph" scrolling="no" style="border:none;" seamless="seamless" src="average_history.html" height="525" width="100%"></iframe>'
        
        <p>
          Indeed, if a customer had randomly selected a flat rate deal amongst a particular retailer group on 1 December 2020 the following bar chart illustrated how much they would have saved (relative to the VDO) over the subsequent year. 
          Interestingly this also illustrates that it is not necessary to investigate all retailers’ offers in order to improve significantly on the VDO – a customer who wishes only to deal with large retailers would also save over $150 over the year.
        </p>

      <section id="structure">
        <h3>The Structure of the Market</h3>
        <p>
          The Thwaites review noted the differences between the large, medium and small retailers and noted that the large retailers were charging amongst the most expensive offers and took this as evidence that the more established retailers were not being put under competitive pressure by the medium and small retailers to lower their prices. 
          They state:
        </p>
        <p class="issue">
          <i>If the competitive market was working we would not expect to see the low-cost supplier at the top of the price range and the high-cost supplier at the lower end</i>
        </p>
        <p>
          This is one of the identified market failures the VDO was supposed to address.  
          To measure this over the existence of the VDO we have calculated the mean best flat rate offers from both the large and medium sized retailers since the introduction to investigate whether the medium retailers have been able to put the large retailers under greater competitive pressure. 
          Our results are shown in the figure below.
        </p>
        
         '<iframe id="igraph" scrolling="no" style="border:none;" seamless="seamless" src="large_vs_medium.html" height="525" width="100%"></iframe>'
        
        <p>
          We have calculated the average flat rate offer over each retail group at quarterly intervals since the introduction of the VDO. 
          On average the large retailers still price at $33 above the medium retailers for a consumer with an annual usage of 4MWh. 
          Only in one case (January 2021) did the large retailers compete with the medium-sized retailers on price.
          It is evident that there has been no significant change in the difference between the large and medium retailers' pricing over this period.
          Therefore, by the contrapositive of the above statement from the Thwaites Review, we can conclude that the competitive market is not working by this measure.
        </p>
        <p>
          Another commonly used measure of market concentration is the Herfindahl Index (HHI). 
          This is calculated by summing the squares of the market shares of all competitors in the market. 
          For example, a monopoly would have a HHI of 1, and a market consisting of 100 participants with an equal market share would have a very small HHI of 0.01. 
          The HHI thus decreases if:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            The number of market participants increases
          </li>
          <li>
            The market is distributed more equally amongst the existing participants
          </li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          The Essential Services Commission investigated how the HHI has changed since 2009. 
          Their research shows that whilst the HHI for the residential electricity market has decreased over the whole period, the HHI has remained constant at approximately 0.13 since the VDO was introduced.
          Therefore we can conclude that the VDO (and other measures introduced as a result of the Thwaites Review) has had no significant effect in increasing the market participants or sharing the market amongst the existing participants more equitably.
        </p>
        <p>
          Another measure of competitiveness of the market that the VDO may have influenced is the distribution of offers from a specific group of retailers.
          The Energy Market Report proposes that customers have a hidden preference for large retailers, so we have focused on these in our analysis.
          A higher variation in the market offers provided would indicate greater choice even for the customers who only wish to deal with the larger retailers.
        </p>
        <p>
          This metric is illustrated in the figure below. 
          For each quarter since the introduction of the VDO we have calculated standard statistical estimates of distributional properties and displayed them in a box-and-whisker diagram.
        </p>
        
         '<iframe id="igraph" scrolling="no" style="border:none;" seamless="seamless" src="evolution_of_large.html" height="525" width="100%"></iframe>'
        
        <p>
          We observe that amongst the large retailers the variance in prices has <i>decreased</i> since the introduction of the VDO. 
          Thus in this measure as well there is no evidence the VDO has had a positive effect on the structure of the market.
        </p>
      </section>
        
        
      <section id="practices">
        <h3>The Practices of the Market</h3>
        <p>
          The Thwaites review noted the complexity of the electricity retail market and that customers find the landscape of the market difficult to navigate and have introduced many measures, such as simplification of billing documentation, that have likely improved customer comprehensive of the market place. 
          Also it is stated:
        </p>
        <p class="issue">
          <i>The best offers in the market are only achieved by active consumers who switch regularly and remain engaged.</i>
        </p>
        <p>
          We examine whether both parts of this statement are true since the introduction of the VDO. 
          One may argue that achieving a significant saving in comparison to the VDO requires significant engagement in the market. 
          It is true that to achieve these savings requires interaction with the market (for example, to request the cheapest market offer that a particular retailer offers) but no knowledge of the different prices that retailers offer is required. 
        </p>
        <p>
          To demonstrate this, we compare the yearly cost (over the period from 1 July 2019 to 30 June 2021) for a reluctant residential customer consuming 4MWh of energy per year on the VDO with a reluctant customer who, over the same period:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            Selects a retailer randomly from a group of retailers every 6 months.
          </li>
          <li>
            Asks for the cheapest flat rate market deal with that retailer.
          </li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          The point of this approach is to demonstrate that no price comparison is required and the (reluctant) customer also does not need to request a complicated offer structure.
        </p>
        <p>
          We have grouped the retailers according to market share and excluded some that either did not exist during the period in question, or had unorthodox pricing structures that would not be appealing to a customer looking to minimize their engagement with the market. 
          Following the classifications that the ESC use in the annual Victorian Energy Market Report, we define a large retailer to be one with at least 5% market share and a medium retailer as one with a market share between 1% and 5%. 
          We make the additional definition of a main retailer as a large or medium retailer. 
          For each day in our offers data set we found the retailer offering the cheapest flat rate deal. 
          The retailers occurring most frequently in this analysis are known as the cheap retailers.
        </p>
        <p>
          The yearly cost on the VDO for this period was $X. 
          The following box and whisker diagrams plot the distributions of 50 reluctant customers following the alternative strategy outlined, for each of the four retailer groups we have defined.
        </p>
        
         '<iframe id="igraph" scrolling="no" style="border:none;" seamless="seamless" src="random_customer.html" height="525" width="100%"></iframe>'
        
        <p>
          We can see that even the most unlucky reluctant customer following the alternative strategy and only wishing to deal with the large retailers outperforms the VDO by over $50 per year. 
          A typical (median) reluctant customer open to dealing with only the large retailers outperforms the VDO by $106 over the year. 
          If such a customer is willing to consider dealing only with medium sized retailers they would typically have saved $139 over the year.
        </p>
        <p>
          It may indeed be the case that:
        </p>
        <p class="issue">
          <i>...active consumers who do their research on energy purchasing options may never secure the best price</i>
        </p>
        <p>
          However, it requires minimal interaction with the market to perform quite well, an example of the Pareto principle.
